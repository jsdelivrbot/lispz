# Installation

This is the shortest section in the book. If you have an Internet connection, then no installation is required. Just point your browser to https://cdn.rawgit.com/paulmarrington/lispz/master/index.html.

# The REPL

While in development mode, a lispz repl is available in the browser by typing <Ctrl><Alt>L. Two entry fields will appear at the bottom of the screen, one for required packages and one for a lispz command. Output will be available on the JavaScript console.
