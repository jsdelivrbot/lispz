# Why another *&^% language?
'''For Fun'''
It is fun to create something new - even when you are following paths well trodden by others for decades. By making your own decisions and learning from them you get a better understanding of the how and why of other languages.

'''Extensibility'''
Few languages macros integrated in the language - where macros are expressed in the language itself. There is no difference between built-ins, libraries and code created by the end-user.

'''Simplicity'''
Many languages and frameworks are overloaded with features - generating a huge learning curve.
