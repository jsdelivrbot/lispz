# List Processing

Lisp was named as a shorter form of 'list processing'. When I first heard of lisp in the early 80's, I did not follow up on it as I did not see the value for my work in a language that gave priority to lists. Who needs specialised list processing when we have loops? This at a time I was using FORTH without thinking that I was treating the stack as a list. Time has moved on (a lot) and with the era of multiple cores starts, functional programming has gained new ground.

Lispz compiles to JavaScript on the browser, so has very little opportunity at this time to use multiple cores. It will work happily with web workers once they become ubiquitous, but that is more the architecture of the workers than the language to use.
