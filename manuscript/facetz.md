# Facetz

Facetz is another front end web components framework - home-grown. I found the learning curve for Angular-1 too steep for many developers. Angular-2 was a bit simpler, but required the support of a huge number of libraries. I did not choose React because I don't agree with in-line mixing of code and HTML.
